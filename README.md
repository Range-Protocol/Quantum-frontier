# Detailed Workflow of `claimNFTWithPermit` Function in `NFTClaim` Contract

## Introduction
The `claimNFTWithPermit` function in the `NFTClaim` contract enables users to claim ERC1155 compliant NFTs using a permit (signature) from the contract owner.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Function Invocation
- **Purpose**: Called by a user to claim an NFT.
- **Parameters**:
  - `tokenId`: Identifier for the NFT.
  - `amount`: Number of NFTs to claim.
  - `deadline`: Validity period of the permit.
  - `signature`: Owner-provided signature authorizing the claim.

### 2. Deadline Verification
- **Check**: Ensures current time is within the permit's validity period.

### 3. Nonce Retrieval
- **Operation**: Fetches the current nonce for the sender's address to prevent replay attacks.

### 4. Chain ID Acquisition
- **Method**: Retrieves the current chain ID, necessary for EIP712 signature verification.

### 5. EIP712 Signature Verification
- **Process**:
  - Constructs an EIP712 digest including `PERMIT_TYPEHASH`, addresses, tokenId, amount, nonce, deadline, and chain ID.
  - Utilizes `SignatureChecker.isValidSignatureNow` to verify the signature's validity.

### 6. Nonce Incrementation
- **Security**: Increments the nonce for the sender's address post successful signature verification.

### 7. NFT Transfer
- **Action**: Executes `safeTransferFrom` on the ERC1155 contract to transfer NFTs from the owner to the sender.

### 8. Function Completion
- **Outcome**: Successful transfer of NFTs upon completion of all steps.

## Important Notes
- The contract owner must authorize the `NFTClaim` contract for NFT transfers.
- The off-chain generated signature by the owner must match the claim request's parameters.
- Relies on the EIP712 standard for secure signature verification.
- Designed to fail securely if any validation step is not satisfied.
